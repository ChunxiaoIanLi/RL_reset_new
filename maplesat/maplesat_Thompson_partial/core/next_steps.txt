Step 1:
    Modularize the reset solver
Step 2:
    Run DRAT-TRIM on all UNSAT instances (SATCoin + SAT2021 + SAT2022) using the weird reset CDCL version
Step 3:
    Run DRAT-TRIM on all UNSAT instances (SATCoin + SAT2021 + SAT2022) using the base CDCL version
Step 4:
    Develop cactus plot for SATCoin + SAT2022 + SAT2021

Results:
1. All UNSAT instances are verified by DRAT-TRIM (except one with memory issue) for both solvers
2. SAT instances are having problem being verified by DRAT-TRIM for both solvers
3. Weird reset solver beats base solver in SATCoin and SAT2021 (by 5 instance)
4. Weird reset solver loses to base solver in SAT2022 (by 1 instance)

Possible Idea:
1. Go back to the normal (correct) reset
2. Weird reset could also support the theory of reset
3. Try different reset frequencies (probabilities) to make the reset solver beat base solver in 2021 and 2022
    -> This would potentially make our argument stronger
4.
